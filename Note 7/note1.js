// 1 - Introducing MongoDB

/* 
mongodb
a document or no sql db. 
no concept of schema, tb etc.

mongo dont need schema or design compared to relational 
db that needs it ahead of time.

simply store the json object ina collection in mongo db.
so when query our data we get json out of mongo and can
simply return those object back to the clinet.
there no transformation.
